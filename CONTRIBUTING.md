# Contributing

When contributing to `PillboxView`, make sure developers keep a few things in mind:

1. Usefulness
2. Appropriateness
3. Respect
4. Kind
5. Cooperative

All submissions will be respected, but to make your submission or concern accepted, make sure it meets this criteria.
As this is open to the community, make sure one is meeting these guidelines.
The closer one meets all of these criteria, the better FOSS will be for everyone

Happy Programming Devs, and I wish you all the luck!
